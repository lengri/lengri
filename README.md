## Hi there 👋
I'm a PhD student in Earth Sciences working on Cosmogenic Nuclides and Landscape Evolution.
I use Python for numerical computations and data analysis! My research areas include Patagonia,
Sierra Nevada, Taiwan, and New Zealand.

## Featured Projects
- **(riserfit)[https://github.com/lengri/riserfit]** – A Python package for morphological dating of fluvial terraces
- **(cosmotracer)[https://github.com/lengri/cosmotracer]** – Combining landlab's landscape evolution modelling with cosmogenic nuclides!
- **(pyLSD)[https://github.com/lengri/cosmotracer]** – Cosmogenic nuclide production scaling factors from the Lifton-Stone-Dunai scaling scheme (Lifton et al. 2014)
